## Sprint 5 
- Unfortunately due to the issue Mac users were having, there was a delay in progress for Sprint 5
- At the time of the meeting, the only feature ready to demo was the ability to Edit a Profile
- Items that were in a work in progress but were completed on the back-end included:
  - Direct Messages
  - Follower/Following action
  - Follwer/Following count update 
- Victoria and Will would work together to complete the above features so they will be available to demo the next day

## Aftermath
- Victoria was able to complete the Front-End portion of the Direct Messages and Following button actions, however was unable to test due to an issue with the UI connecting to the API Server
- Will suggested to push all changes. and he was able to work through everything to ensure it worked in both the Front-End and Back-End (life saver)
