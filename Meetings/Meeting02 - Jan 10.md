## Finalize Project Idea 
- App Name: SoundPalette 
- Platform: Android App 
- Main Idea: Social Media Platform for Artists (musicians, art work, producers, song-writers etc) 

## Existing Problem 
- There does not currently exist a social media platform for dedicated artists to collaborate, display their work or grow a following 
- Many artists will share their work with multiple existing social media platforms such as YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, Twitter etc 

## Importance 
- SoundPalette fills in this niche that is designed and dedicated for artist to collaborate and showcase their work all in one space 
- Provides exposure of smaller scaled artists to grow their network where their posts are currently getting lost in cooking reels and influencer’s post of their vacation 
- Artists thrive working as a community and often get inspired by one another. SoundPalette helps curate and foster this environment, allowing the art industry to prosper and grow 

## Description 
- Users are able to create an account and select a role and genre 
- Roles could include Musicians, Guitarist, Artist, or could even just be a Follower who is looking to explore new music or commission an art piece 
- Users will be able to follow, like, comment, save posts and direct message one another to encourage discussions and collaboration 
- Artists are able to post their work on their social media feed 
  - Sound bites, images etc 
- No video due to cost 
- Users are able to search for other accounts based on genre, artists etc 
- Artists can specify in their bio is they are available for collaborations, what services they offer and what they may be looking for 
- Artists can use hashtags on their posts and specify things like the genre to attract more users, as well tag other accounts 

## Next Steps 
- [ ] Everyone will come up with 10-12 user stories each over the weekend 
- [ ] Next meeting is scheduled for Monday January 13 @ 4:00-6:00pm 
- [ ] We will review all user stories, remove any duplicates, discussion the features we need to enable to accomplish these user stories  
- [ ] Parth and Kaija will create a product backlog after Monday’s meeting based on the decided list 
- [ ] Victoria will create a Sprint backlog based on the Product Backlog when completed 
- [ ] Release Planning Meeting on Thursday or Friday where we will review Sprint and Product Backlog, get feedback, split responsibilities/tasks 

## Foreseeable Future 
- Will (Lead Developer) will work with Development team to set up the back-end and a main landing page for the Android App 
- Everyone will then split out their responsibilities and work on their own tasks 
  - Ideally will be ready before Reading Week 
- Two additional in person meetings on Jan 20-24 to discuss, design and review the technical design for development team to begin implementing back-end
