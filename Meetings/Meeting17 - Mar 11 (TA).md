## Sprint 4 
- Will was able to successfully implement all data to come from the API Server, replacing all previous dummy data. This included posts, comments, likes, saved etc.
- James was able to successfully complete Profile registration, edits, and pulling the bio from the database. He began implementing Tags which are 80% complete, the next steps are to display the Tags in a user's profile and in the post, along with search capabilities.
- Victoria successfully implemented Comments, along with the ability to view another user's profile. Posts were updated to now display the count for Likes and Comments, and the Profiles were updated to be able to display count of Followers/Following.
- Kaija and Prab were unfortunately sick during this sprint and were advised to rest and focus on other assignments and classes in the meantime. Although there is no tangible work to be shown for their efforts, they've been researching how to implement the glassmorphism design previously discussed.
- Parth has begun the planning for all software testing and exploring different tools available. There has not been anything pushed to the GitHub repo, however he has a lot of his work stored on his personal laptop and noting any potential threats and bugs.

## TA Feedback
- Had questions related the app: Inquired whether Posts will be a single type (text, photo or audio), or whether users are able to post multiple photos, or overlap audio with text.
  - Unfortunately due to time constraints and our skillset, we've opted to only allow the single entity. Although it is something we can explore, we must factor in the time to also perform software testing
- Reminded group of next Progress Report due on Sunday March 23 which will be before our next bi-weekly meeting
- Inquired about group contribution and morale
  - Explained this was actually something our group spoke about yesterday. We do not hold any resentment against the division of work that has occurred over the previous sprints.
  - We are much more concerned about our team members recovering and putting in 100% when they feel 100% because we trust one another and know that everyone wants to pull their weight.
  - We have been fortunate to shuffle responsbilities that afford members to not have to contribute during this time, and can actually contribute in the later sprints (however the workload will be larger which we've acknowledge).
  - Overall, our team is extremely supportive of one another and are happy to be working together.
