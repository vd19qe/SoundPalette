## UI Discussion
- Prab and Kaija started implementing a glass appearance for the Posts, along with a gradient background
- We will be leaning into this design and incorporating a glassmorphism UI appearance
- Background will contain dark colours to balance the bright accent colours, and enhance the glass appearance
