### [4 Hour Full Tutorial by Caleb Curry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZvjSl9dswg&ab_channel=CalebCurry)

Although the video is 4hrs long, you can definitely watch it at 1.25x or 1.50x speed. He does a really great job of explaining things more in-depth and providing you know long term knowledge, instead of just how to use one specific thing.
The tutorial doesn't start until the 40 minute mark, before that is the installation process and learning about the Android Studio IDE.

A RecyclerView is essentially a dyanmic list where you recycle an object (eg. box with an image) and it gets repeated with new information based on the dynamic list. The most common example of this is your Contact list. This will be extremely helpful when building the UI for the Home Page/Feed or Discover/Trending page.

###[Simple Calculator Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DGLcL4v6Qo&t=726s)

Although a calculator seems unrelated to our project, there is a lot of useful application that you can reuse for our project. For example, the calculator reads in the user's selections while for our app, you'll need to learn how to read in the input entered into a textbox, or read in the user's selected button. It will also help you make the connection between the UI and the functions needed in order to perform the calculations entered when the user hits "=".
