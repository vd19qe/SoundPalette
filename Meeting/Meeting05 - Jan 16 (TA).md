## Review Goals and Scope
- The objective of SoundPalette is to offer the general public a social media platform catered towards artists, ranging from poets to music producers to musicians to visual artists.
- Our app's main goal is to provide the users the ability to post their work (text, images and audio), collaborate through direct messaging, and interact with other accounts by liking, commenting, following and subscribing to one another.
- Artists will be able to monitize their work through subscriptions. Artists can set a price for subscribers to receive exclusive content.
- The app will have a `Home Page` which will display posts based on the user's followed post tags, and have the ability to toggle on/off viewing posts from accounts they are currently following
- All users will have access to the same `Discover` page which will display the most popular posts in SoundPalette based on the number of view, likes and comments.
